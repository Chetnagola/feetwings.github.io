**FeetWings** is a smart textile company that helps in early detection & prevention of diabetic complications using non-invasive, affordable & continuous monitoring.

Your major work as an app developer would be hardware and software integration, building the way people would view things (with the assistance of the UI/UX designer) and ensure that data is properly displayed on the app.
